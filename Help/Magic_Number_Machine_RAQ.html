      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If I type 5318008 on my pocket
calculator and turn it upside down it spells BOOBIES. If I use Magic
Number Machine and turn my monitor upside down, I hear a popping sound
and the screen goes black. Can you help?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
Find a computer where the monitor isn't permanently ruined and try
184594917 in decimal before putting the calculator in hexadecimal mode.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What with all the "reality"
television nowadays?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
I know! I don't know what the networks consider to be "real" but most
of those people are <span style="font-style: italic;">way</span> too
attractive.<br>
      <br>
Of course, networks like "reality" TV because it's cheap and the same
10% of people who watch one "reality" show will watch them all --
resulting in reliable ratings.
Everyone else gets their cheap porn on the 'net instead and dreams
wistfully of a time when a "script" was something given to the
"actors",
not followed by the publicists.<br>
      <br>
Actually, I have an idea for a "reality" show... it's about a
programmer who pitches an idea for a "reality" TV show to a group of
network executives. They give him $1 million prize-money for no reason
at all and he gives them the finger. We could draw the whole thing out
to 13 episodes with long ad-breaks and fire-side chats that repeat
things that just happened.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is that "&middot;" symbol?<br>
      </span><br>
That's an implicit multiplication. You've entered two numbers into the
expression and haven't used anything to separate them. The program has
assumed you want to multiply them. The symbol is used to remind you
what is happening.<br>
      <br>
i.e. 5sin90 gets turned into 5 &middot; sin90 so that you know that sin
and 90 go together and the 5 is multiplied by the result.<br>
      <br>
To combine the numbers in a different way, enter a different operator
between numbers.<br>
      <br>
i.e. 5 + sin90<br>
      <br>
This operator is also used if you include multiple results from the
"Data" drawers. <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
You say this program contains
bugs. What do you mean by that?</span><br>
      <br>
Known, outstanding issues for Magic Number Machine include::<br>
      <ul>
        <li>it could invite other programs over for a party and not
clean up the mess</li>
        <li>it could pass messages to the kernel that contain lewd
caricatures of you</li>
        <li>it could sign you up for spam</li>
        <li>it could use up all the number 2's on your computer so that
you have to start using backwards 5's.</li>
      </ul>
If you experience anything better, consider it a blessing.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What kind of name is Magic
Number Machine for a calculator?</span><br>
      <br>
Consider the name SGI gave their calculator: SciCalc. Then there was
Steven Constenoble's Mac OS 7-9 calculator, <a
 href="http://people.hofstra.edu/staff/steven_r_costenoble/scicalc.html">SciCalc</a>.
Brent Jenkins made a calculator for the Palm OS called SciCalc. There's
even a few hundred online javascript calculators called SciCalc. I even
wrote a calculator for Mac OS X beta (and subsequently updated it for X
10.1) called... wait for it... SciCalc.<br>
      <br>
Sure there are some more interesting names: <a
 href="http://www.pcalc.com/">pCalc</a>, <a
 href="http://www.wundermoosen.com/wmMooseCalcDownload.htm">MooseCalc</a>,
      <a href="http://www.macropodsoftware.com/koalacalc/">KoalaCalc</a>,
      <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Edelaneyrm/MPCalc.html">MPCalc</a>,
etc. The list goes on. I got "Calc" overload.<br>
      <br>
Instead I turned to the wicked, pagan-sorcery side of arithmetic,
creating a device of purely mystical design? Sure, why not. Actually,
it's a misheard quote from my childhood (--"I'll trade you three hills
and a mountain for this <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic Number
Machine</span>." -- "Ooooh.").<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Your calculator doesn't have
[insert feature I don't care about here].</span><br>
      <br>
You didn't word your statement in the form of a question. I didn't go
through milliseconds of hardship typing a "Q" in the title of this page
for no reason.<br>
      <br>
All right, I'm feeling generous. I'll assume you meant to ask: "How do
I get [insert feature I don't care about here] added?" or "Will you add
[insert feature I don't care about here] for me?".<br>
      <br>
The short answers are: you code it yourself and I won't add it for you.
The long answer is that if everyone asks for something and it doesn't
seem like too much work, then I may add it.<br>
      <br>
Quick tip: a programmable calculator seems like too much work. You can <a
 href="Magic_Number_Machine_Source_Code.html#Useful_Bits_To_Hack">add
your own functions easily</a> with only a little programming and there
are other calculators that can do most of the rest (like the <a
 href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/math_science/x48.html">HP
x48 simulator</a>). A graphing calculator seems like even more work.<br>
      <br>
Still impatient? Try these:<br>

for really high precision, really quickly<br>

        <li><a

for dates and times and stuff</li>
        <li><a
 href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/math_science/rpncalculator.html">RPN
Calculator</a> for unit conversion and complex number stuff</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/">Mathematica</a>
for everything plus a hole in your pocket (seriously: thanks to Wolfram
Research for funding Eric Weisstein's <a
 href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/">ScienceWorld</a> &#8211; Magic
Number Machine would suck without MathWorld's help).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">I can't program, can you help me?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
Yes I can, but I won't. Programming is something really hard to teach.
It takes years to do well. I will only have time to give minor
assistance to would-be developers.<br>
