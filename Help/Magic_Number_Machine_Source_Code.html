This document will walk you through the design of the program and how
the various components work. If you're just interested in changing a
piece of the code, try jumping ahead to the <a

      <br>
Alternately, all of the source files have a block comment at the top
which explains (tersely) what the file does. You can just dive straight
into the code.<br>
      <br>
Still, if that ain't your thing...<br>
      <br>
      <big style="font-weight: bold;">Top Level Design</big><br>
      <br>
Internally, the program is structured something like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 445px; height: 243px;" alt=""
 src="top_level_design.png"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">There is always a single
DataManager object, a single InputManager and a single DrawerManager.
These classes are all created when the program awakes from its NIB file.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">DataManager</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
The DataManager is the hub of the program. It manages most of the
persistent data and manages communication between the other two
managers, the ExpressionView (the main view in the window) and the
currentExpression (which is the data displayed in the ExpressionView).<br>
      <br>
The DataManager owns most of the important data in the program,
including the currentExpression, the expression history and all of the
data arrays.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">InputManager</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
All user input through the buttons in the window, and most other
methods, gets routed through the InputManager. The InputManager handles
the fairly boring tasks of converting button presses into messages sent
to the current expression. Ideally, if I was following the model I drew
up above, the InputManager would communicate these messages to the
DataManager which would then pass them on to the currentExpression but
I hate writing pass through interfaces so the InputManager sends the
messages to the currentExpression directly.<br>
      <br>
Interesting point... the InputManager inherits from NSView because I
shove it into the responder hierarchy as first responder so that it can
handle copy and paste from the menu. Why I didn't just use the
ExpressionView as the first responder (it would be more correct from a
conceptual point of view) is historical more than anything else (the
ExpressionView didn't exist when I first put in copy and paste and I
was too lazy to do it right).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">DrawerManager </span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
This is a misguided bucket of a class. It manages both the behaviour
and the data associated with the drawers. It moves the drawers in and
out (fun) when required, populates the various tables with data and
handles user interaction with the expression history and data arrays.<br>
      <br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expressions</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      </big><br>
In case you haven't worked it out by now, everything displayed in the
big white part of the window is called an expression. The view is an
ExpressionView but you can work out how it operates yourself; here we
will look at how the Expression class works.<br>
      <br>
Expressions are made by a tree of classes, each of which inherits from
Expression. Each node in the tree has one parent (except the TreeHead)
and most can have one child. Exceptions to the one child rule are
BinaryOp, which is the only type of node that can have two children,
and Constant (and its decendent Value) which have no children.<br>
      <br>
A typical Expression tree will look like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img
 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 467px; height: 367px;" alt=""
 src="expression_tree.png"><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: left;">The top box shows an expression
and the bottom box shows the tree that contains it.<br>
      <br>
The most difficult part of an expression tree is maintaining the order
of operations while allowing the expression to be edited. I've done two
things to try to help with this: firstly, as the expression moves left
to right across the line, each term gets deeper down the tree (this
makes deletion right to left easier).<br>
      <br>
The second point is that + and - BinaryOps always get appended to the
left, whereas &#8226;. x. / and % get appended to the right. When things get
deleted in the middle, it gets kinda wrong. Have a look at replaceChild
in BinaryOp for more.<br>
      <br>
Interesting to note that there is little internal different between a
PreOp and a PostOp &#8211; they only really differ by how they are entered.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding another function to the
Data Functions</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
Insert another object in the dataFunctionRows (roughly line 56 in
DrawerManager.m). The object should be defined like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">[NSArray
arrayWithObjects:@"Name", [NSValue value:&amp;@selector(function:)
withObjCType:@encode(SEL)], nil],<br>
      </div>
      <br>
where "Name" is the name that you want the function as in the data
function table. "function" is the name of a function that you should
add to DataFunctions.m. The "sum" function is a good one to look at...
it is very simple and shows how to perform basic arithmetic and return
a result. You can also change data in the array directly if that makes
sense.<br>
      <br>
The 2D and Array functions work in exactly the same way... just add an
object to the arrayDataFunctionRows or data2DFunctionRows as
appropriate. Interpreting the NSMutableArray "values" is a little
harder to work with in these cases. I recommend looking at one of the
other functions first to see how its done.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding/Changing the Constants in
the Constants Drawer</span><br>
      <br>
Even easier than above, just add or change a line that looks like this:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">[NSArray
arrayWithObjects:[NSString stringWithUTF8String:"name"], [BigCFloat
bigFloatWithDouble:123456 radix:10], nil],<br>
      </div>
      <br>
in the constantsDataRows definition at line 100 of DrawerManager.m.
"name" is what will appear in the constants table and 123456 is the
value that will be inserted.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brushed Metal UI</span><br>
      <br>
Though I'm sure I don't know why you would...<br>
      <br>
Open the Magic Number Machine project file. Open the Interface.nib file
in the Resources folder. Click on "Main Window" in the Instances
window/tab. Select "Show Info" from the Tools menu. Click on the
"Textured Window" checkbox.<br>
      <br>
Save the file, close it and choose "Build and Run" from your
development environment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Implementing division</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
When implementing BigFloat.m, the single hardest part was implementing
the division. Something I didn't realise until I had to do it for
myself, is that if you store your number in blocks of bits (BigFloat
uses blocks of 16-bit values), you have to set a maximum limit on each
block that is a power of your radix minus 1. ie For base 10 numbers in
16 bit, it is important to limit each 16-bit block to 9999. Why does
this matter? Without it, you can't do long division.<br>
      <br>
Division has stacks of other quirks. If you need to implement it
yourself and are tired of people telling you to look it up in Knuth,
read divideBy in BigFloat.m &#8211; it isn't fast but it's straightforward
and reasonably self contained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting the Bezier Path of text</span><br>
      <br>
Have you ever wondered how? It's hard to work out from documentation
alone. Try looking at line 707-718, 753-761 and line 885, all in
generateValuePath in Value.m. As of this writing, be careful to
explicitly release the NSTextStorage (or else a weird bug will crash
your program) and don't use getGlyphs:range: instead of the repeated
calls to glyphAtIndex, since it also crashes periodically. I don't
think these functions get called much.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
Things I haven't implemented but would be really useful for the greater
good of the world:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Fix any bugs you find and submit the fixes back to me<br>
        </li>
        <li>Have symbols appear instead of numbers for the Constants</li>
        <li>Make the Expression History and Data Arrays persistent so
that if you quit the program, they're there when you start next time.</li>
      </ul>
Extra credit (because its really hard)<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement a Gamma function for BigCFloat<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
