# Magic-Number-Machine
Updating this classic for the latest OS X.  

From the original author [Matt Gallagher](http://projectswithlove.com/magicnumbermachine/) :

Machine Number Machine is a graphically displayed, high-precision, scientific calculator featuring:

* **25 (now 50) digits of precision.**
Using the "Disp" button you can increase the precision up to 25 digits or apply scientific notation or fixed precision.

* **Full expression view, graphically laid out.**
So that 2 over 5 appears as a 2, over a 5. You can also change the insertion point to go back and correct mistakes.

* **Hexadecimal, binary, decimal and octal display including fractional, scientific notation and negative numbers in each.**
Great.

* **Complex numbers.**
For people who know how to pronounce Euler. *Hint: doesn't rhyme with Bueller.*

* **Data values (memory to store values) and statistical functions to apply to them.**
Hit the "Data" button to add something to data. Then use the "Data" drawer to apply functions to the data.

* **Array functions.**
Because humans are bad at solving simultaneous equations.

* **An expression history.**
Go back to anything.

* **Large number of scientific constants available.**
If you want other constants, open up the source code and change them.

* **Totally bug free -- not. Plenty of bugs.**
You'll never run out.
